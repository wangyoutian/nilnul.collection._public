	/// A set is a finite or infinite collection of objects in which order has no significance, and multiplicity is generally also ignored (unlike a list or multiset). Members of a set are often referred to as elements and the notation  is used to denote that  is an element of a set . The study of sets and their properties is the object of set theory.
